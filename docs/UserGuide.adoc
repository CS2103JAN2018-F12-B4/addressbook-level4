== Introduction

LoanShark Tycoon is for 21st century Loanshark bosses who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing operations*. More
importantly, LoanShark Tycoon is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, LoanShark Tycoon can get your
operations management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get
started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.

[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

.  Download the latest `LoanSharkTycoon.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]. (_to be updated_)
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n: John Doe p: 98765432 e: johnd@example.com a: John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
